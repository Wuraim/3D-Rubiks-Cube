This interactive 3D Rubik's cube simulator demonstrates the power of modern web technologies for creating engaging browser-based experiences. 
Built with Three.js, it renders a fully manipulable 3D cube you can rotate, twist, and solve right in your browser. 

The automatic solving feature uses the CubeJS library, which implements Kociemba's algorithm to quickly find efficient (though not necessarily optimal) solutions for any scrambled state.
Try dragging the cube to rotate it, use the controls to shuffle or solve it automatically, and watch the state display track each change in real-time.
